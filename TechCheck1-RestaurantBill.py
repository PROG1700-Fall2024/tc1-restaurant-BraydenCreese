# Restaurant Bill 
# You will create a console-based Python program that will calculate the amount of the tip, the tax, and the 
# total amount of a restaurant bill. The program will prompt the user to input the original amount of the bill. 
# The program will then output the amount of the tax (15% of the original amount) and a tip (20% of the original amount). 
# Finally, the program will output the new total of the bill.

I was going to implement a error handling function to this but for the sake of simplicity I did not, also assuming the user will not have the ability to enter a negative number or letters into a restaurant bill calculator/pin pad.

but I would have done something like this as I see it as good practice to follow error handling.

total = input("Enter your bill total: ")
try:
    total = float(total)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid Entery! Please enter a number.")
    return

basicly just taking the try func for this part of code because it is an input that could cause an error, if there is an error it moves it to the except block and in this case is executing only if a ValueError is raised. so a "abc" is entered into a float var. 
then it prints out the error message and makes the user enter a number.
